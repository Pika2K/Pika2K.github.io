    Hong Kong Heritage List #1: The Murray House
</h1>



<div>
    <p1>
        The Murray House is a prominent landmark in Hong Kong that was originally built in 1844 as officers' quarters for the British army. <br>
        The building was originally located in the Central district but was dismantled in 1982 to make way for a new Bank of China tower and moved to its current location in Stanley in 1990. <br>
        During the Second World War, the Murray House served as a military hospital. After the war, it was converted into government offices and later into a luxury hotel. <br>
        The building has since been refurbished and now houses restaurants and shops. Its historical significance and unique architecture make it a popular tourist attraction in Hong Kong.<br>
        However,its original classification as a Grade 1 building has not been transferred to the rebuilt building as the current Murray House is considered a relocation project that does not meet the international standard for heritage preservation.

For reference, the guidelines and criteria conditions for the evaluation of historical assets are as below:
        <br>
- Historic and aesthetic significance
        <br>
- Scientific or research significance
        <br>
- Social and spiritual significance
